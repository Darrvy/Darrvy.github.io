<h1>Accessibility Rich Internet Applications(ARIA) </h1>
<p>
When it comes to web development it is recommended that native HTML is used when creating a web page since they provide keyboard focus, keyboard support, and semantics.

ARIA is used to supplement HTML but also fix areas that native HTML can't fix for accessiblity. ARIA is meant to help areas that need it but proper HTML semantics should be used over ARIA if it exists. This is because the native elements already have built-in keyboard accessibility, roles, and states. This doesn't completely mean that a user can't create their own elements, if they so choose to create their own element that mimicks an existing element then it is the developers resonsibility that they use correct ARIA attributes to enable accessibility.
