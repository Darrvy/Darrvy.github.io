<h1>Dockerfile</h1>

<p>I decided to do my post on Dockerfile since it was something new I learned and I found it interesting to do.</p>

<p>A Dokerfile is a way to create an image. A better way to explain this is that the dockerfile has all the recipes for creating your image. A Docekrfile is it's own unique file which is different from batch, shell script, etc. </p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p><code>FROM</code>this command is going to be in all of the dockerfiies that a user creates. A user can indicate here what kind of distribution they want to create thier image off of like alpine, debian, ubuntu, etc. If a user wants to create their own image from scratch instead of having an existing distribution, <code>FROM ubuntu:latest</code> they would have to use <code>FROM scratch</code></p>
<p><code>ENV</code></p>
<p><code>RUN</code></p>
<p><code>COPY</code></p>
<p><code>ADD</code></p>
<p><code>CMD</code></p>
<p><code>EXPOSE</code></p>
