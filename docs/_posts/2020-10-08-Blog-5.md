<h1>CSS Flexbox</h1>

<p>
    Flexbox is a way of styling on-dimennsional layouts for webpages. It's a CSS display type like block, table, etc. but the difference is what a user is able to do with <code>display: flex;</code>. With flex a user can create many different types of layout options in a simple, brief and comprehensive manner, instead of a janky matter. By using flex it works well with a responsive design and layout, and is probably one of the best options for vertical design and when the heights of things are unknown. Instead of a user using floats or inline-blocks a user can just declare display: flex on the parent block and the child blocks will match up accordingly with the help of the properties used in flexbox.
<p>
    Though flexbox is great for solving many isssues and allows for better customization there are some limitations and issues. For example, older broswers and older phones that have not been updated do not support the flex property. Also, for more complex layouts CSS grid would be better to use as it works in two dimensions compared to FLexbox's one dimension.
