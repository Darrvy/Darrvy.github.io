<h1>CSS Flexbox</h1>

<p>
    Flexbo is a way of styling on-dimennsional layouts for webpages. It's a CSS display type like block, inline, table, etc. The difference is in what display: flex can achieve. In short, flex can perform many different layout options in simple, concise, and non-hacky ways. It works exceptionally well with responsive design, and it is the current best option for vertical alignment when heights are unknown. Think of a world where you don't have to use floats or inline-blocks for your layout. Instead, you declare display: flex on the parent, and the child elements will conform accordingly according to additional properties that come along with it. Most importantly: flex-flow, justify-content, align-items, align-content, and order.

    As far as I'm concerned, it's the absolute best solution for many CSS issues. Plus when you dig deeper (especially with the order property), it does things that weren't possible in CSS in the past. The only issue is older IE versions and older Android. Foundation and Semantic UI both use it (along with other frameworks). It is the future and I advise everyone to learn it.
