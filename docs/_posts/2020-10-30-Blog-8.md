<h1>CSS Grid</h1>

<p>
    CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout that is different than flexbox. Where flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system Grid is a 2 dimensional layout system and it can accomplish the same things that flexbox is able to. One of the things that makes Grid very appealing is that it can lets a user align their items in columns and rows but it also allows them to create a lot more layouts. By using flex it allows a user to not use common css properties like floats based layouts though it doesn't replace them entirely.

    Though grid may look like tables it is not tables at the end of the day. Grid is probably the most flexable thing in my opinion.
