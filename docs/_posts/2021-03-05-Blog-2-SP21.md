<h1>SQL Injections</h1>

<p>
    SQL stands for Structure Query Language, and it used to build a query where a user will be able to find information. So to keep it short it is a language used to extract information in a database.

    <br>
    In web development where a company for example has multiple users and those users have unique user names or passwords SQL injections are something they have to be warry of. This is because with the input fields a hacker using SQL injections could potentially delete users, retrieve, user name, passwords, or even log into an account with SQL injections.
